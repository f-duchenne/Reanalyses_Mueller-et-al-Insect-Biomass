Here is our R code to reproduce the analyses presented in our answer to Müller et al (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06402-z)

1. The script "add_landscape_to_dataset.r" is used to extract Corine Land Cover and interpolate yearly values for each plot.
2. The script "Re-analysing_data.R" is used for performing the main analyses, based on the R code provided by Müller et al. (Figure 1-2 & 4)
3. The script "Model_validation.R" is used to perform model validation (Figure 3)
